    EdgeBuilder

    Simplifies construction of edges in the graph. The graph is assumed to be undirected.
    The idea is that at the start, we know the maximal number of edges and vertices in the graph.
    The constructor allocates approximate space. Then we can add edges one by one using the `push!.`
    Finally, when done, we `construct`, returns the computational graph.


Example of use
```julia
nv = 7          # number of vertices in the graph
capacity = 5    # number of edges
arity = 2       # arity of the edge

eb = EdgeBuilder(arity, capacity, nv)
push!(eb, (1, 2))   # add edge (1, 2)
push!(eb, (2, 3))   # add edge (2, 3)

ds = construct(eb, :x)  # returns the computational graph pointing to `:x` in knowledge graph
BagNode  # 7 obs, 304 bytes
  ╰── ProductNode  # 2 obs, 32 bytes
        ├── ArrayNode(Colon()×2 KBEntry with Float32 elements)  # 2 obs, 88 bytes
        ╰── ArrayNode(Colon()×2 KBEntry with Float32 elements)  # 2 obs, 88 bytes

    Wraps `EdgeBuilder` and adds features on edges. The features on edges are mainly
    used to identify type of edge, as we want to compare between edges with features
    and multi-edges. When building the featured edges, there is also an option to 
    duplicate and deduplicate edges. When `agg = nothing,` edges are not deduplicated,
    which is faster during construction but it might be slower during inference. Conrary,
    when `agg=Function` (`+` is the default), the same edges are deduplicated and their 
    features are aggregated by `add`.
